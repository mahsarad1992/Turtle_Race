# Turtle_Race 
In this game, the player guesses which of the 7 turtles that are created in different colors and placed on the starting point of the race would reach to the right side of the screen before others. By starting the game, the turtles start moving with random length of steps. If the players guess was correct, they win; otherwise they lose.
